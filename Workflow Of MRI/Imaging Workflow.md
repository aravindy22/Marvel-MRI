# Patient & Proton Alignment
- The patient is placed in a strong magnetic field (B₀), aligning hydrogen protons in brain tissues.

# Slice Selection
- A slice-selection gradient and RF pulse excite protons in a thin brain slice.

# RF Excitation
- RF pulses tip the net magnetization into the transverse plane.

# Signal Relaxation
- Protons relax via T1 recovery and T2/T2* decay, emitting MR signals.

# Spatial Encoding

- Phase encoding gradient encodes position in one direction

- Frequency encoding gradient encodes position in the perpendicular direction

# K-Space Filling
- Signals are stored line-by-line in k-space, each line representing a different phase-encoding step.

# Fourier Transform
- A 2D Fourier Transform converts k-space data into spatial image data.

# Image Formation
- Pixels are formed and contrast (T1, T2, FLAIR, etc.) reveals brain anatomy and pathology.
