# DICOM
DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is the international standard used to store, transmit, and manage medical images and related patient information across imaging devices and systems.

## Key Points

- Combines image data + patient/study metadata in one file

- Enables communication between MRI/CT/US scanners, PACS, RIS, and workstations

- Ensures vendor-independent interoperability

- Supports image transfer, storage, printing, and worklists

## What a DICOM File Contains

- Patient details (ID, name, age)

- Study & series information

- Image pixel data

- Acquisition parameters (TR, TE, slice thickness, etc.)

## Where DICOM is Used

MRI → PACS (image transfer)

RIS → Scanner (Modality Worklist)

Viewing, archiving, sharing medical images

## Summary 
DICOM is the language that medical imaging devices use to store and exchange images with patient information.
