# Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a **non-invasive medical imaging technique** used to produce highly detailed images of soft tissues such as the **brain, spinal cord, muscles, heart, and internal organs**. Unlike X-rays or CT scans, MRI **does not use ionizing radiation**. Instead, it relies on **strong magnetic fields, radiofrequency (RF) waves, and signal processing**.


MRI is a powerful imaging modality due to its flexibility and sensitivity to a broad range of tissue properties.

MRI stems from the application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to radiological imaging.

The term 'magnetic' refers to the use of various magnetic fields, and 'resonance' refers to the need to match the frequency of an oscillating magnetic field to the precessional frequency of a nucleus's spin in a tissue molecule. The term 'nuclear' in this context refers to the benign role of the nucleus's spin in the process, not to anything harmful or dangerous.

The term 'nuclear' has been largely avoided due to public concern, leading to the widespread use of the acronym 'MRI' instead of 'NMRI'.

## The Origin of Magnetic Resonance Imaging

- The origins of MRI can be traced back to 1973 with significant contributions from Lauterbur and Mansfield.

- The concept of MRI is based on the known fact that the spin of a hydrogen nucleus (proton) in a magnetic field precesses around the field at the 'Larmor frequency', which depends linearly on the field's magnitude.

- Lauterbur and Mansfield proposed that if a spatially varying magnetic field is applied to an object, the Larmor frequencies will also vary spatially.
- By separating different frequency components of the signal, they could obtain spatial information about the object. This concept of spatially encoding the data was crucial for MR imaging.

- The principle of using a magnetic field gradient to capture the essence of MRI was a breakthrough idea.

- The concept of nuclear magnetic resonance is rooted in the discovery of the proton's spin.

    In the 1930s, Rabi and coworkers studied the spin of the proton and its interaction with a magnetic field, building on the earlier work of Stern and Gerlach.
    In 1946, Bloch and Purcell extended these early quantum mechanical concepts to measure the precession effect of the spins around a magnetic field. 
    
    They successfully measured a precessional signal from a water sample and a paraffin sample and explained many experimental and theoretical details still in use today.

    Bloch and Purcell were awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1952 for their work.
